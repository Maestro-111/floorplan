# Unit Number OCR


### Workflow
1. We use the trained model to classify key plates objects for each image
2. After that we copy resulting key plates to the 'test' folder inside this repo
3. Finally, we use CRAFT to analyze the extarcted key plates. CRAFT stores the result in unit testing repository.


### To run the prog:
1. Run the classify_cnt.py file
