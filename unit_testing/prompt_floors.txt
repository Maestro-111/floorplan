Given these strings separated by ';' derived from the floor plan image with the help of OCR engine: {}
        
determine, on which floors the current floor plan is located.
Note that the floor value might be either a word like 'ground floor' either an interval like '1,2,3' or '1-3' or either a single number like '1'.
For  example, if OCR response contains 'floors 1-3' and 'floors 4-5' you response should be '1-3' and '4-5'. In case floor value is a word like 'ground floor' the reponse should be ground floor.
If floor value i single number, like '1', the response should be 1. Finally, the OCR response may contain both floors in interval like 'floors 1-3' and floors in single numbers like '1'.
In this case reponse should be '1-3' and '1'.

So, format the output STRICTLY in the following way:

floors: list all found floors with coma delimiter. For example, floors: 1-3,4-6,7,8,9
