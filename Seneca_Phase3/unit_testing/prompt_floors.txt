Given these strings separated by ';' derived from the floor plan image with the help of OCR engine: {}
        
determine, on which floors the current floor plan is located. 
You are going to determine the minimum floor and the maximum floor and then create an interval with the min floor and max floor.
Note that the floor value might be either a word like 'ground floor' either an interval like '1,2,3' or '1-3' or either a single number like '1'.
For  example, if OCR response contains 'floors 1-3' and 'floors 4-5' you response should be 1-5. In case floor value is a word like 'ground floor' the reponse should be ground floor.
Finally, if floor value i single number, like '1', the response should be 1.

So, format the output in the following way with respect to 3 cases listed above:

1) if floor is interval then format the reponse in this way: floors: found min-max, if no found value for floor say 0-0.
2) if floor is a word then format the reponse in this way: floors: found word, if no found value for floor say 0-0.
3) if floor is single number then format the reponse in this way: floors: found number,if no found value for floor say 0-0.
